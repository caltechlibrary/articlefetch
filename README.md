# articlefetch

This is a web client that is intended to harvest PDFs from an RDM repository (e.g. CaltechAUTHORS) using the list of articles for an individual available <feeds.library.caltech.edu>.  It first retrieves the JSON file for articles from feeds, then uses that to retrieve the records from RDM using the metadata files object. This then is parsed and used to retrieve the specific PDFs associated with that record.

It was created as a re-usable tool as a means of allowing content to be aggregated for use in projects of Caltech Archives.
